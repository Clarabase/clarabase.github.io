As developers, we spend a lot of time writing boilerplate plumbing code for our APIs, in particular the {{< link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" >}}CRUD{{< /link >}} operations. Having to do repetitive tasks is error-prone and detracts you from what truly matters: delivering value to your users through innovative features and creativity. CRUD operations and all the supporting layers such as validation, error handling, pagination, etc. are essential, but they’re not what makes your software unique.

This repetition led us to create {{< link "https://www.clarabase.com" >}}Clarabase{{< /link >}}, a fully managed API builder built to save developers time and let them focus on the creative, valuable aspects of their applications. Clarabase is a fully managed API platform that takes care of all the plumbing code for you. All you need to do is define your data shape, and then you’ll instantly get a production-ready service without the need for deployments, complex setup, or infrastructure management.

## Writing Plumbing Code is Counterproductive

Building a basic REST APIis straightforward conceptually, but it's very time consuming when building for production. Take into account all of the supporting layers that go into building an API:
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete actions for data
- **Validation and Error Handling**: Ensuring requests are reliable and secure
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Controlling access and securing resources
- **Versioning, Pagination, and Caching**: Managing scalability as your application grows
- **Storage**: Managing data persistence and retrieval
- **Rate Limiting**: Controlling access and ensuring fair usage
- **Usage Tracking**: Tracking and reporting on API usage for billing and analytics
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Keeping track of your API's health and performance
- **Infrastructure**: Scaling, caching, load balancing, and other infrastructure concerns

While necessary, these tasks are often repetitive and take time away from more meaningful work. Clarabase offers a managed solution for these requirements so developers of all experience levels, from seasoned engineers to hobbyists, can focus on what makes their applications unique.

## The Right Amount of Abstraction

Clarabase is not just a shortcut to creating APIs; it’s a new way to manage your application’s foundation. Here’s what sets it apart:

- **Instant, Production-Ready APIs**: Define your schema, and Clarabase takes care of the rest. You get a REST API with an OpenAPI spec, GraphQL support, and (coming soon) gRPC stubs — all scalable from day one. We make schema definition easy with our lightweight {{< link "https://json-schema.org/" >}}JSON Schema{{< /link >}} editor.
- **Your Data is Yours**: You 100% own and control your data entirely and are free to take with you whenever you want.
- **Platform-Level Versatility**: Clarabase’s roadmap extends beyond APIs to offer storage and real-time capabilities, making it a comprehensive platform layer for your application. This flexibility lets you grow your app with new features, without leaving Clarabase.

### Feature Set
Here’s a taste of what you’ll find with Clarabase:
- **Automatic OpenAPI Spec Generation**: Define your resources in a JSON schema, and your API is ready with a full OpenAPI spec
- **Automatic Validation**: Your schema determines validation rules, so all requests are validated without extra setup
- **GraphQL and gRPC Support**: We support both REST and GraphQL out of the box, with gRPC on the way
- **SDKs and Libraries**: Prebuilt client libraries for popular frameworks like Express, FastAPI, Next.js, and SvelteKit to integrate directly with your existing applications or are perfect starters for new projects.
- **Data Viewer**: View your data directly within Clarabase to keep track of the resources you’re building.


### Built with Developer Experience in Mind
- **Avoid Vendor Lock-In**: Unlike other platforms, Clarabase is open and flexible. Our roadmap includes bringing your own database and data seeding tools, ensuring you’re never locked into our infrastructure. You can adopt it gradually without concerns about committing long-term.
- **Scalability Without Infrastructure Overhead**: Whether you’re testing a new feature or building a full production app, Clarabase handles scaling, caching, and versioning, so you can focus on functionality instead of infrastructure.
- **Immediate Setup, Zero Deployment**: Define your data and immediately get a functional API, storage, or soon, real-time features. Clarabase takes care of the hosting, validation, and security, so you can build and launch quickly.
- **Experimentation without Barriers**: No infrastructure or servers are needed to get started, making Clarabase a risk-free, fast way to bring your ideas to life. This is perfect for side projects or new startups looking for a solid backend foundation.

## Building for the Future

Our vision is to make Clarabase a core part of your development workflow, freeing you from infrastructure setup and scaling concerns while giving you full control over your data and business domain logic. We’re building a tool that hobbyists, startups, and enterprises alike can use without sacrificing security or flexibility. Hopefully we've sparked your curiosity as we’d *love* for you to give Clarabase a try (for free!) at {{< link "https://app.clarabase.com" >}}https://app.clarabase.com{{< /link >}}.
